# Binary Audio Classifier adapted from WaveNet

---

## Goal:
Build a classifier to distinguish sounds of laughing from those of crying.

---

## Status:
Work in progress.

---

## TODO:
* Streamline preprocessing pipeline (mp3 -> TFRecord)
* Process viable dataset for classification (manual editing)
  * Data augmentation (possibly)
